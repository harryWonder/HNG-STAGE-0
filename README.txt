Hello. My name is Ilori Stephen Adejuwon. I am a fullstack software developer and I am currently competing in the HNG Internship for a chance to elevate my career as a software developer.

This process or stage as you might call it requires that I play around with a git a bit by creating a simple repository with a single commit which in this case is the README.txt file.

I have created a simple blog on Lucid which would teach you how to get started with Git. But for the mean time, Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

In order not to waste your time, I will show you some simple steps that will get you familiar with Github.

1. Download Github for your operating System and follow the installation instructions.
3. Create a Git repository by visiting https://www.github.com. !Don't forget to signup or login.
4. Create a simple project
5. Open the project up in your terminal an try the following commands.
  1. git init
  2. git add .
  3. git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
  4. git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL_ENDING_WITH_A_DOT_GIT
  5. git push origin master
6. If you have any issue, you can read my blog on Lucid. Thanks for reading. Once again, I remain Ilori Stephen A.
